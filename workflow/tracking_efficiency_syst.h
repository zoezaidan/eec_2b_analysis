// Tracking-efficiency systematic
// ============================================================================
//
// Track reconstruction in the core of a jet is prone to mismodelling in
// simulation. To propagate that through the unfolding we randomly throw away a
// fraction (nominally 3%) of the RECONSTRUCTED tracks in MC during the
// substructure extraction, redo the whole chain, and take the symmetrised
// difference of the unfolded distribution against the nominal one as the
// uncertainty.
//
// Applies to MC only, and only to the reco-level tracks (trk*). The gen-level
// b hadrons (refTrk*) are the truth and are never touched -- the variation is
// a detector effect, so it must move reco while gen stays put, which is exactly
// what makes the response matrix and the corrections change.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE RANDOM NUMBER IS HASHED RATHER THAN DRAWN FROM A STREAM
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// "Repeatable" has to mean more than "seeded". A seeded std::mt19937 consumed
// as a stream gives the same answer only if the tracks are consumed in exactly
// the same order, by exactly one process, over exactly the same event range.
// This analysis violates all three: run_agg_ntuple_chunks.sh runs one job per
// block in parallel, the number of blocks changes per sample (10 qcd/pythia,
// 9 bjet/pythia, 8 qcd/herwig, 9 bjet/herwig), and the Condor data path splits
// differently again. With a stream, re-chunking the sample silently changes
// which tracks are dropped, and the systematic moves with it.
//
// So instead of drawing the n-th number of a stream, the random number for a
// track is COMPUTED from the track's identity:
//
//     u = hash(seed, entry number, track index)  ->  uniform in [0,1)
//     drop the track if u >= 1 - dropFraction    (3% -> drop if u >= 0.97)
//
// The number attached to a given track is then a property of that track, not of
// the processing history. Consequences, all of them wanted:
//
//   * running the same job twice gives bit-identical output;
//   * running with a different number of blocks, in a different order, or in
//     parallel vs serial gives the same output;
//   * resuming or re-running one failed block reproduces exactly what the
//     first attempt would have written;
//   * the nominal and the varied production see the *same* events, so their
//     difference is the track dropping and nothing else.
//
// The hash is splitmix64: fixed integer arithmetic, so it is also identical
// across compilers and machines, which std::mt19937 seeding conventions and
// std::hash are not.
//
// (ient, itrk) identifies a track within one input file. The same pair in two
// different blocks gets the same u, which is harmless: those are unrelated
// events and the decision is uncorrelated with anything physical. Deliberately
// NOT salted with the file name, so re-running over moved or renamed inputs
// still reproduces the published numbers.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// HOW TO USE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One boolean, everywhere: track_eff_unc = false is the nominal (every function
// below is a no-op, output bit-identical to before this header existed),
// track_eff_unc = true is the systematic. Set it with
//
//     TrkEffSyst::enable(track_eff_unc, isMC);
//
// The 3% itself is kDropFraction below -- one constant, not a number spelled
// into each caller, so there is nothing to keep in step by hand.
//
// create_files_for_template_fit() takes both as arguments; run_agg_ntuple_chunks.sh
// and make_hardprobes_condor_scripts.sh set them from one knob at the top and
// tag the output files so a variation can never overwrite the nominal.
