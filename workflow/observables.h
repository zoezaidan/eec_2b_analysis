#ifndef OBSERVABLES_H
#define OBSERVABLES_H

// observables.h -- the measured observables, and the axis abstraction that lets the chain
// fill more than one of them in a single pass over the data.
//
// WHAT AN "OBSERVABLE" IS HERE
// ----------------------------
// The chain measures a quantity built from the two aggregated B hadrons of a 2b jet, binned
// against jet pT, with m_2B as the template-fit variable:
//
//     templates    TH3D(m_2B, X, pT)
//     response     2D (X_reco, pT_reco) <- (X_gen, pT_gen)
//
// X is the observable. For the whole history of this analysis X was dR and nothing else, so
// "the second axis" and "dR" were the same thing and dR was written into every histogram
// name, loop bound and binning lookup by hand.
//
// X is now a parameter. ObsDef carries everything that differs between observables -- the
// binning, the overflow fold, and the suffix its histogram names carry -- so adding a third
// observable is a binning vector plus one ObsDef, not another copy of the chain.
//
// WHY THE VALUE IS NOT IN HERE
// ----------------------------
// ObsDef deliberately does NOT carry a function that computes X from the two B four-vectors.
// dR is computed by tTree::calc_dr, which returns Float_t and takes Float_t arguments, so it
// truncates to single precision at two points. Reimplementing that here to satisfy a uniform
// interface would change dR in its last bits, which would change every existing result for
// no reason. The caller computes the value -- three lines per observable, at the point where
// the four-vectors already exist -- and passes it in. The genericity that was actually worth
// having is in the booking, filling and writing of ~40 histograms per observable.
//
// ADDING AN OBSERVABLE
//   1. binning vector + fill cap in binning_histos_small.h
//   2. an ObsDef for it below, and a line in obsByName()
//   3. compute its value next to dr/B in create_files_for_template_fit.cpp, and add it
//      to BOTH obsList() and obsValues() there (a size check refuses to run otherwise)
//   4. its tag in result_paths.h: isKnownObservable, observableTag, obsProdTag, and the two
//      nominal* conventions (does it carry the UParT SF? is it an EEC or a yield?)
// Everything downstream of that iterates the ObsDef list.
//
// ⚠️ An observable only exists in MC produced AFTER the code that fills it. obsProdTag()
// says which production carries which observable, and a run pointed at an older one fails
// on a missing histogram rather than silently reading the wrong axis.
//
// WHAT IS MEASURED RIGHT NOW (2026-09-22)
// ---------------------------------------
// Two observables: dr (the EEC axis) and B (the momentum balance). The three b/non-b
// momentum fractions -- fnb, fb and lnfb -- are COMMENTED OUT, here and in
// binning_histos_small.h, result_paths.h and create_files_for_template_fit.cpp. They are
// left in place rather than deleted so that re-enabling one is four uncommented blocks.
//
// ⚠️ THE MOMENTUM BALANCE IS CALLED B, NOT z (renamed 2026-09-22 at Zoe's request, so the
// code matches the plots). The rename reached the histogram-name suffix ("_B") and the
// production tag, so MC written by the earlier "_z" code cannot be read by this code --
// step 1 has to be re-run. See obsProdTag() in result_paths.h.

#include "TString.h"
#include "binning_histos_small.h"   // guarded, so including this header twice is safe

#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

// ---- B: momentum balance between the two aggregated B hadrons -------------------------
// ONE definition, shared by the chain and by momentum_balance_mc_study(). Duplicating it
// is exactly the failure mode result_paths.h was written to end: two copies of a mapping
// drift, and the disagreement shows up as a plausible-looking number rather than an error.
//
// The namespace keeps its name: MomBalance says what the quantity is, and the rename was
// z -> B on the OBSERVABLE's name, not on the thing that computes it.
namespace MomBalance {

// [0.5, 1) by construction. Symmetric in its arguments, so the order the two B hadrons come
// in does not matter -- which is why reco (SV order) and gen (best-EEC-pair order) can be
// compared directly without a matching convention.

// DISABLED 2026-09-22: the three b/non-b momentum fractions.
//
// fnb, lnfb and fb are commented out -- the measurement is dr (EEC) and the momentum balance
// B only. Their value functions are kept verbatim below, together with the reasoning about
// what counts as "b" and "non-b" on each side, which is the part that would be expensive to
// reconstruct. Re-enabling one means uncommenting here, in binning_histos_small.h, in
// result_paths.h (isKnownObservable / observableTag / obsProdTag / the nominal* conventions)
// and in create_files_for_template_fit.cpp (obsList and obsValues, which size-check against
// each other), then re-running step 1.

/*
// ---- fnb: how much of the jet is NOT in the two B hadrons ------------------------------
// Requested as 1/(1 + pT_b/pT_nonb), which is algebraically pT_nonb/(pT_b + pT_nonb) -- and
// that is the form used here, because it is still defined when pT_nonb = 0 (a jet every one
// of whose tracks went into the two Bs is fnb = 0, not a division by zero).
//
// Same functional family as z, which is also 1/(1 + ratio): z = pT_lead/(pT1 + pT2) is
// 1/(1 + pT_sublead/pT_lead). Both map an unbounded ratio onto [0, 1].
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS "b" AND "non-b" (decided with Zoe, 2026-09-17):
//   pT_b     scalar sum of the two aggregated B hadrons' pT -- reco_sv[0].Pt() +
//            reco_sv[1].Pt() at reco, the best-EEC gen pair at gen. Scalar, not the vector
//            sum, to match how z combines the same two objects.
//   pT_nonb  the tracks of the jet that did NOT go into those two B hadrons:
//            RECO  jet tracks with pT > 1 whose BDT score fails the b-track cut. Nothing
//                  else is left over -- the aggregation absorbs every no-SV track that
//                  passes the cut into the nearer vertex -- so this is exactly the
//                  complement of the B reconstruction.
//            GEN   jet refTracks with pT > 1 and refTrkSta < 100, i.e. not from a B decay.
//                  The exact analogue: PartialBsAggregation builds the gen Bs from status
//                  >= 100 with the same pT cut.
// No b-tagging BDT cut is applied on the non-b side: selecting the non-b component with a
// b-likeness score would bias it towards b-like tracks, and gen has no BDT to match anyway.

// through a 1/(1 + ratio) rewrite (confirmed with Zoe, 2026-09-21) -- the earlier phrasing
// "f_b = 1/(1 + pT_nonb/pT_b)" was an algebraic aside that made a direct quantity look
// indirect, so it is gone from the code, the comments and the axis labels alike.
//
// ⚠️ The VALUE is unchanged by that rewrite. pT_b/(pT_b + pT_nonb) is what this function
// always evaluated, so every number produced before 2026-09-21 is still correct and no MC
// production had to be redone -- only the labels, which the plot macros read from ObsDef at
// draw time rather than from the stored histogram titles.
//
// This is the complement of fnb above (their sum is 1), so it is the same split of the jet,
// monotonically transformed. It carries no new information -- what changes is where the
// resolution goes.

//
// ⚠️ THIS IS EXACTLY 1 - fnb, and on the uniform [0, 1] binning both observables use, bin k
// of fb is bin (nbins+1-k) of fnb -- the response matrix mirrors too. It is therefore NOT new
// physics, and a disagreement between an fb result and the corresponding fnb one is a bug in
// one of them, not a measurement. It exists as its own observable so that the axis a plot
// carries is the quantity that was asked for, rather than a mirrored relabelling of another
// one, and so it can be unfolded and banded by the same chain as everything else.
//
// It is also the argument of the log in LogBFraction above: lnfb = ln(1 + fb). Same three
// numbers, three ways -- fnb, fb, lnfb -- filled in one pass because they cost one extra set
// of histograms each and let the binnings be judged against each other.
