    //
    //   "SF variation"              (sfupart_jphf) the alternative SF CURVE is divided into
    //                               the data instead of the central one, and the difference
    //                               from the nominal EEC is SYMMETRISED -- one alternative
    //                               gives the size of the shift, not its direction.
    //   "SF uncertainty propagated" (sfupart_jpsyst_up/dn) the quoted per-bin SF UNCERTAINTY
    //                               is added to / subtracted from the central SF, coherently
    //                               in every dr bin, and the pair is combined signed: the
    //                               member that pushes the result up sets the upper side,
    //                               the one that pushes down sets the lower.
    //
    // Those two phrases are the legend text, so the plot and this comment cannot drift.
    //
    // Each band is therefore drawn exactly as that treatment would enter the total, so the
    // plot answers "which band do I get if I choose this one".
    //
    // The two carry the SAME per-bin magnitudes: h_SFb_dr_syst_jpcalib_hf is exactly
    // |h_SFb_dr_jpcalib_hf - h_SFb_dr_central| (checked 2026-09-14, all 8 bins). They differ
    // only in the SIGN PATTERN -- the SF variation keeps the measured one, which flips across
    // dr and so reshapes the EEC and survives the unit-area normalisation; the propagated
    // uncertainty applies one coherent sign, which is close to a pure normalisation and
    // largely cancels in it. That is why the bands come out different sizes, and why booking
